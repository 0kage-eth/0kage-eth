# About Me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @0kage-eth... a defi builder, analyst and MEV searcher. I believe in capital markets, hard money, sovereignty and frictionless exchange of capital, ideas and culture - that is what draws me to crypto & defi. I believe in playing long term positive sum games.
- 👀 I’m interested in... defi derivatives, MEV & arb opportunities. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... Solidity, MEV, ReactJS, SQL scripting in Dune. I am continuously learning by building small web 3.0 applications with neat UX and a back-end with 100% code coverage 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I'd love to work with teams working to bring Defi to masses. I also want to work with teams working on MEV projects
